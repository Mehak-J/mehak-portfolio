    <h3>CONCEPT<br> </h3>
    <p>This game of Tic-Tac-Toe, created by Shreya, Helen, and I, is a two player game & designed like the standard board of Tic-Tac-Toe.The game will work by storing values in a 3x3 grid sort of like a numpad with numbers 1-9. Each player gets a turn to select a box which corresponds to a number on the backend. These numbers are stored, and used to check against one of the 8 different winning number combinations.<br>

     <br> Ex: if a player has selected a box in positions 1, 2, and 3, that player will win because they have a straight across line.
     The order of these numbers does not matter because they just need to have the whole set. Ex: 1,2,3 or 4,5,6; Once a person wins, it will display the win message for whichever player met the win conditions.</P>
 
    <h3><br>MOTIVATION<br></h3>
    <p>
     <br> Known to play worldwide<br>
      Easy and fun to play for all age groups<br>
      It encourages social interaction by more of a collaborative play<br>
      We made it our goal to memorize all winning combinations<br>
      We wanted to try recreating an og idea with our own touches as well.<br>

    <h3><br>CONCLUSION<br></h3>
    <p>Overall, we had a lot of fun making this game. We would have liked to make the cartoon graphics move and interactive, but we couldn't do that with the  time constraints. Other than that, our game was a hit...we had many students play it during presentation and it was an as expected full functioning Tic-Tac-Toe game.
