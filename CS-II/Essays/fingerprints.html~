    <center><h3>Internet Connection Security </h3></center>
    <p>
With the growth of the internet, people have begun to use it as a resource for sharing important personal information such as medical bills, banking info, and more, which was once done in the real world. Although the internet makes our already fast-paced lives more efficient, our data is more susceptible to threats than ever before. To combat these threats, websites that once used unsecured HTTP web connections began to switch to HTTPS. The two primary purposes of a secure https connection are to keep users use of the internet, or data, personal and private. 
      </p>
    <p>
     HTTPS web connections benefits those who want their internet use to remain unpenitratable. Private institutions responded negatively to the loss of visibility in their users online interactions. An Https Proxy Appliance was used inorder to get back user visibility. This is done using a Pseudo Certificate Authority to the user's browser/computer. If the user trys to connect to a remote web server, the browser connects to a local Proxy Appliance which logs all material and content from the browser and sees whether or not it abides by the policies of that local network. The data is re-encrypted so that it looks like nothing has happened using SSL interception.
    </p>
    <p>
      An SSL interception cannot be prevented, however; it can be detected because it is not easy to completely copy any security certificate. An SSL interception can be detected with a cryptographic hash. The fingerprint hash bits will change if even 1 bit inside the certificate has changed
      . A hash is a complex mathematical algorithm which carefully processes every single bit of a certificates content and detects change by changing the
      fingerprints in response.
      </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, private instituions are not the only ones who use proxies. Anyone who knows what they are doing can use proxies similar to intercept user data and grab their information -known as MITM. MITM stands for man-in-the-middle which basically implys that someone else obtain access to everything a user enters in a browser. It presents risks such as lack of privacy and security.
    </p>

    <p>
      A CA stands for Certified Authorities. Certified Authorities play the role as a trusted third party which ensures that a users secure information goe
      s dirctly to the website they intend to use.
      Companies with a larger presence may have multiple security certificates, meaning that it is not necessary that every user of that service will recie
      ve the same certificate. This may mislead users to believe that their connection is being intercepted when they actually recieved a different valid certificate(false-positive). A false positive is the belief that SSL interception is occurring when it is not. A false negative is the belief that an SSL interception is not occurring when it has.
      </p>
          
    <p>
I do not think it is okay for anyone to be eavesdroping into my communication whether its online or in the real world. My interactions online should be private to me and everyone needs their privacy.
