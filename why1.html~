	A digital portfolio is a beneficail tool for me to create and use to showcase my skills to others. I can use this portfolio as a way to keep track of my progress and make short-term goals to fulfill later on. It serves as a reminder of my own abilities and I woud like to continue uesing it as I gain more technology related knowledge. I want to use this tool to share in my college application and future internships. I created this portfolio inorder to showcase my creations and growth as I continue to learn skills related to the field of computer sciene. This portfolio can help me track my own progress and create goals that I will fulfill later on.
