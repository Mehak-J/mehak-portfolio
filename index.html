      <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
      <p>
	Hi there. My name is Mehak Jay, and I currently attend AHS as a junior. I took Computer Science 1 last year. I am taking Computer Science 2 this year. I became interested in programming after learning about machine learning in data science from professional data analysts. I also began participating in our high school's CS clubs for fun. Since then, I have gained some basic knowledge of Swift, Java, and HTML, but I still have a long way to go...

	MORE OF MEHAK<br>
	Poor baby Mehak was forced to move from place to place because of her parent's jobs. She lived in Australia for seven years and developed a mini Aussie
	accent, then India for 3 years where she lost the Aussie accent. The rest of the time I lived in the most random places within the U.S. All jokes aside, I absolutely
	love to travel, and doing it from a young age gave me exposure to all sorts of people.
	
	<br><br>

	As a person, I am fun, practical, and easygoing. My favorite pass time is achieved by playing video games and hibernating in my house all day. Being indolent is unfortunate because I own a high-energy puppy, Jaggu, who has to play ALL THE TIME. For some reason, Mr.Jaggu believes four am is the best time to wake me up. That is why I officially consider myself a morning person.
