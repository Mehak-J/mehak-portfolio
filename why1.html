      <p>
A digital portfolio is a beneficial tool for me to showcase my creations to others. I can use this portfolio to keep track of my progress and make goals to fulfill later on. It reminds me of my strengths and weaknesses, and I can use this to gain more technology-related knowledge. I want to share this portfolio in my college applications and future internships. As I continue working on more projects, I will add them to my portfolio and get a visual understanding of what I have learned from them(this is good for me because I am a visual learner).
